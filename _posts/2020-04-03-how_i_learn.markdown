I love how programming is about being resourceful. Well, all learning is but I haven't really felt that way with traditional schools. I would spend hours memorizing passages in textbooks only to pass the next test and seemingly, forget everything by the following months. 

I'm happy to say programming is not a memory game. There are some fundamental concepts you'll want to grasp along the way and for me, that's the easy part. The hard part comes from digging. Hitting a wall and then having the resilliency, determination and understanding to get past it. I know it can be needlessly stressful when not all the answers are in one place so I'd like to share my Learn process:


1. Read through the lesson and jump right into the lab.
2. Hit a test that I don't understand and spend no more than 20 minutes analyzing the spec file.
3. If I'm getting an error message still, I'll either google it, view passing code on github and if it seems like an unusual technical problem, I use ask a question.
4. Once I understand why I was failing, I compare various passing code and create a solution to my liking.


When it comes to project time, that's when I feel l learn the most since I have an idea and a framework but implementing my desired style/structure will be a unique problem I'll spend hours researching. It can be frustrating but it's this type of problem solving that feels so gratifying to me in the end.
