I have video games waiting for me right now. My Sinatra project is a video game catalogue. You sign-up, login and store video game info. It's more basic than I'd like but it gets the job done.

Thanks to Avi Flombaum videos and my work on Fwitter, most of the framework was set for me. However, one hurdle a had to overcome was implementing a form in which only congruent game data could go through. I did this by setting consoles and the number of players attribute to radio buttons.
	
Another was to display the user's games as a grid rather than a list. Thanks to BootstrapCDN's CSS and this line,
	`<div class="col-sm-4">`

I was able to populate game titles into columns of 3.

Google is my best friend and I love being in an industry where struggling to solve a problem is part of the fun.
